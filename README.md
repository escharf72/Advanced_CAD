My CAD Assignments (Elisabeth Scharf)
The files in this repository are all Solidworks assignments that I have completed in the module of Advanced CAD. 

# Assignments:
- ## Gearbox
**Goal:**

To take the gears that I had aleady created (I did this assignment last year because I used gears in my project) and create a box that would involve all four configurations of the gears and fit together nicely. 

**Lessons learned:**
1. Don't be overwhelmed by the complexity of the finished product, just take it step by step. When working on a project, especially in engineering, it is very important to keep in mind the finished product and the requirements involved in creating such a product. However, if that is all that you focus on you will never be able to acheive it. It is important to be able to break down the larger task into smaller steps (like this assignment did for us) and to work on it piece by piece. 
2. Doing it right the first time will save you major headaches in the future. Last year we sort of sped through the gears assignment, thinking only of the project that we had for that year. That haste came back to bite us this year when we realized that we had a few issues with the configurations and weren't so comfortable with the basics of how configurations work. It really is worth it to take it slow the first time around and make sure that you really understand it. 
3. RELATIONS!!!!! They are so, so, so important. On the gear plate relations rather than dimensions are the way to go. The make everything much more neat and organized and if, perhaps, you realize that your big dimensions were completely wrong, you can change them and it doesn't mess up everything else.

- ## Motion Study
**Goal:**

Practice Solidworks skills by making an assembly and then explore the cool Solidworks feature called Motion Study. 

**Lessons learned:**
1. Solidworks in pretty amazing. Not only can you design 3D parts to be perfectly dimensioned and fit together perfectly, you can also create a test environment similar to how it would be in real life and test out your parts before you go to the trouble of printing them out. This saves time and money and is super cool. 
2. It's really cool to take a moment to stop and realize just how far you have come. This was the fastest I have ever made any parts and it is crazy to see how easy it has become through practice. I've learned how to work smarter not harder with relations, how to constrain sketches without crazy amounts of dimensions, and how to use all sorts of features to make interesting and unique shapes. This assignment was the first time that I realized how far I've come in three years of learning CAD.

- ## Stress Analysis
**Goal:**

Create a part in Solidworks, test its ability to handle stress with the Stress Analysis tool, and then provide a solution for making it stronger in the areas where it is most likely to break under pressure. 

**Lessons learned:**
1. Even CAD needs logic. I thought that just code needs logic in order to work, but it turns out that there is a significant amount of practical thinking that is required to make a useful part in Solidworks. I had never though to consider the FOS (factor of safety) and the different amounts of stress that would be on the different parts of a piece because I've never had any reason to do so. But I can see how important it would be in a real-world situation to make sure that your product can withstand much more than a normal amount of stress. 
2. It requires both creativity and logical thinking to create an elegant solution to a real-world problem. It must be a practical solution that solves the problem, while also not dramatically altering the appearance or function of the object.
